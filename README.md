## üí° Inspiration
We are on a Mission to Save Lives of people who suffer from weather changes such as heat waves, excessive heat, global warming, and more by providing real-time alerts, location-based nearby services, valuable reminders, and more that will help them tackle this issue.

Here is what's happening around the globe due to Summer:
- 166K+ lost their lives
- 3.6mm/year increase in sea level
- 175M+ people affected
- 5% fall in GDP

## ‚ùì What it does
We try to provide the minimal yet best solution, features such as:
- Weather Warning
- Drinks Reminder
- Medical Support
- Weather Report
- Music based on weather
- Plant a Tree
- Explore Nearby
- Community Support

<details> <summary>NextJS Guide </summary>
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
